##  üìç What is QIWI ?

QIWI is a QIskit Windows installer will set up Qiskit and a local copy of VSCode on your computer, with a ready-to-use Python virtual environment for Jupyter notebooks.

<br />

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important notice before installing  

- Only install software on a computer that is not production-level or mission-critical to you. (This is a general truth that does not pertain only to this installer.)

- If the installation fails: Create a fresh user account ([tutorial video for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpPZ1oBjsnM)) and log in under this account to install Qiskit. This will help insulate your Qiskit SDK from other software you may have installed on your computer. This is particularly important if your computer already has a complicated installation history of software frameworks.

<br />


## üí• Installation

### üèÉ Running the script!   

- **Method 1** (recommended if you're ok with downloading and executing an executable on your computer): Download and execute the [qiskit_installer.exe](https://github.com/ket-q/qiskit_windows_installer_pub/raw/refs/heads/main/qiskit_installer.exe)


  
- **Method 2** (if you want visibility into what you will execute) : Run script with powershell:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **- Step 1**: Download the script qiskit_installer.ps1
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **- Step 2**: Open a powershell console and navigate to the qiksit_installer.ps1 download file.\
  &nbsp;\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Usually, when opening a powershell you will be placed at the user root and you need to go to the Downloads 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;folder (or any other folder where you downloaded the script)*
  
  ```powershell
